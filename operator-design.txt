- Operators are either:
(1) Field Creator: Outputs fields on the current row.
(2) Row Creator: Creates a nested rowset, outputing zero or more rows, and fields
on those rows.

- Row creators are indicated by the rowset="name" attribute on the <produces>
element.

- Input arguments can be either references to fields in the enclosing scope, or 
constant literals.  Constants must be prefixed with the "c:" or "const:" namespace.

- If operator input is not required and has no default, the special EMPTY argument 
will be passed at runtime.

- The built-in <field> operator creates a field from a constant literal.

- The built-in <rowset> operator creates a new nested rowset containing a single row.
