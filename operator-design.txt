- Operators are either:
(1) Field Creator: Outputs fields on the current row.
(2) Row Creator: Creates a nested rowset, outputing zero or more rows, and fields
on those rows.

- Row creators are indicated by the rowset="name" attribute on the <produces>
element. An optional row="name" attribute indicates the XML elements contained
within the rowset.  If row="name" is not provided, <row> is used.

- Input arguments can be either references to fields in the enclosing scope, or 
constant literals.  Constants must be prefixed with the "c:" or "const:" namespace.

- If operator input is not required and has no default, the special EMPTY argument 
will be passed at runtime.

- The built-in <field> operator creates a field from a constant literal.

- The built-in <rowset> operator creates a new nested rowset containing a single row.

- Special XML namespace prefixes: 
[q: or query:] indicates part of the query language, to disambiguate cases where
a name in the query language collides with a name in the business domain.  
Examples: 
q:version (q:v) - indicates operator version, inherited down.
q:rowset - indicates nested rowset name.

[c: or const:] indicates a literal argument. This is just a shorthand for using 
the <field> builtin.
