If necessary, use the appropriate bottom bracket (BB) tools to remove play. Depending on what type of BB you have, you may need to remove the crankarm first. Any play in the BB bearings makes it impossible to properly adjust the front derailleur. While you_re working on the crankset, check each crankbolt with the 5-mm allen wrench to make sure they_re tight.Lift the chain off the smallest chainring and place it on the bottom bracket of the frame. Turn the crank by hand while looking at the chainrings from above. Using one side of the front derailleur cage as a reference, observe the trueness of each ring. If they wobble, true them by prying gently with the adjustable wrench (set the jaws just wide enough to slip over the ring). Another way to do this is to tap on the wobble with a plastic mallet. This takes a little practice, but it works nicely when you get the hang of it.Place the chain back on the ring. Next remove the cable end cap, loosen the anchor bolt with a wrench, and remove the cable from the housing (if applicable). Replace a rusted or frayed cable and cracked or corroded housing. Run the new cable through the lever, housing (or BB guide), and stops to the anchor bolt (photo). Don_t tighten it yet. Apply spray lube to the derailleur pivot points and wipe off the excess.

Lower handlebars are an advantage in climbing steeps, because you can get your weight onto the front of the bike easier. The height of the handlebar depends on the stem, the thing that attaches your handlebar to the steering mechanism.

Now loosen the stem. (Some stems are held in place by a compression fitting of the locknut -- they'll already be loose at this point.) If there's a dust cap on top of the stem, pop it off. Insert a hex wrench into the bolt at the bop of the stem and turn until the handlebars move independently of the wheel.Slide the stem out of the steering tube. Carefully place the handlebars in a position where you won't kink the cables! For example, you might use a wood clamp to attach the stem to the side of the steering tube. Now loosen the bearing cup with your headset wrench (or whatever). I usually tilt the bike so the fork will stay in place. Put a big pan or cloth underneath, to catch any loose bearings.Slide the front fork away from the steering tube. If the bottom bearings don't come out with the headset tube, reach inside the bottom of the steering tube and fish them out. If the bearings aren't held in a clip, put them in a bowl and count them (top and bottom separately), so you get them back correctly.Put the front wheel back on (if you took it off).

Every 90 days, pull off your tire, remove the goop and replace with new sealant. If you don't it gets thick and gels up.  Stan's sealant weakens the rubber in tire sidewalls. After a couple of months, the tire may blow out. Specialized brand tires seem more prone to this.  If you have a UST tubeless wheel, try running a standard tire with 2 ounces of Stan's tire sealant. This is lighter than any other type of tire setup.  The Stan's system can be replicated on your own. You can buy sealant more cheaply at an automotive store. Rim strips can be made using a smaller diameter tube and a razor blade. (There's a technique to making the strips, but it can be done.)  If you use the Stan's sealant, there's no need to patch small leaks. The initial plug will harden with heat and use. 'Slime' will eventually come unglued, and the old hole becomes a new hole.  There are ways to seal non-UST rims with packing tape and electrical tape that works quite well, so you don't have to buy the Stan's rim strip.  The bead area on a non-UST tire is rougher than a true tubeless tire, and tends to slowly leak air. Wipe some Slime (or other gooey brand of tire sealer) on the bead of the tire and on the inside of the rim before inflating the tire. But DON'T do this unless your wheel is up away from sand and dirt!  Get a bunch of 2-ounce plastic squeeze-bottles from the craft store. Cut the nipple so it has a big opening, but still fits inside the stem of the tire liner. When filling, be sure you get plenty of 'chunks' in the sealant -- they help clot bigger holes. Pack a bottle in your Camelbak every time you ride.  Buy a mini-pump that doubles as a CO2-cartridge inflator and a standard pump. With bigger tires, the CO2 inflator may not fill the tire hard enough. With a double-function inflator, just use the pump to top off the pressure after the CO2 seals the tire.  Look for a CO2 inflator that uses small-necked, non-threaded cartridges. You can buy replacement cartridges at the sporting goods store, for less than half what you'd pay at the bike shop.  Buy a small compressor with a reservoir tank to inflate your tires (paint store). Get a cigarette-lighter power inverter, and toss the compressor in your trunk on your biking trips. You'd be surprised how many times it's saved me $3 for a CO2 cartridge, and even the non-tubeless guys love it.  Once you're committed to tubeless, consider Schraeder-valve rim strips. You won't need an adapter to inflate the tire, and with the core-removing tool you buy at Checker Auto, you can replace a valve core when it plugs up with hardened sealant.  Buy BIG tires. Don't be seduced by the lightweight racing slicks. For example, a 1.8-inch tire doesn't contain enough air to keep the rim from pushing the tire hard into rock edges. Because these tires have no tread and are paper-thin, they'll literally slice on the edge of the rock, and you'll walk home.  Always take two inner tubes with you. You never know when you'll get both tires punctured.</content></section></articledata>",First name Last name,1/18/2008,Tubeless tire tips,tubeless tires,First name Last name,1/18/2008,Published,Procedure

Handgrip installation can involve some technique. To remove old grips, if they will no longer be used, you can cut them off with a large knife. If you want to save them you can use one of these techniques:1. Blow compressed air under the inside edge of the grips, and they will easily slide off. Do not fill the handlebar with compressed air. It is slightly dangerous and unnecessary. 2. Lay a pair of tongue and grove pliers over the handlebar (with a cloth layer between to avoid marring the handlebar) and against the edge of the grip. Bash on the side of the pliers with a soft hammer to drive the grip off.To install grips, put a little plain water on the grip and handlebar, and slip the grip on all in one smooth movement. Do not ride the bicycle until the water has dried and the grip is tight. If the grip is stubborn, and gets stuck part-way on, you can blow compressed air at the edge of the grip, and the air will flow between the grip and the handlebar, acting as a lubricant. If compressed air is not available, you can bang on the end of the grip with a soft hammer. </content></section></articledata>",First name Last name,1/18/2008,Installing hand grips,hand grips,First name Last name,1/18/2008,Published,Procedure

KBA-01034,Service,suspension overhaul,{01ca785a-1a94-4ad8-a107-fd27cbc83157},"<articledata><section id='0'><content>Remove the front wheel.Remove the front brake, and the bridge piece that holds the brake and keeps the fork tubes parallel. You may find removable plastic caps in the tops or bottoms of the fork tubes that can be carefully pried out with a screwdriver.You may find allen (hex) head bolts in the tops or bottoms of the fork tubes. Unscrew these, and you may be able to pull the forks apart. You may find a C-clip in the top of the fatter portion of the fork tube. Carefully remove the C-clip with a pin tool if you have one. It can be done (carefully) with a small screwdriver and needlenose pliers, but you must have a high tolerance for frustration if you do it that way.Pull the fork tube apart slowly, keeping it in an upright position. This is in case there is oil in the fork. If so, it can spray all over the place if you pull the fork apart too quickly. Keep track of the amount of oil, and replace with the same amount if the seals have not been leaking. Otherwise, consult the manufacturer's specifications for the amount of oil to use.Clean forks carefully, because left over dirt or corrosion can quickly ruin the seals.Reassemble and adjust, making sure that the fork tubes are set to the same height. Put all the bolts in loosely at first, so that you can put them all in without struggle and without damaging the threads, then tighten them all when assembly is complete. Note that many of the screws thread directly into cast aluminum alloy, which is easily damaged. Put a little grease on the screw threads if you ride in adverse wet conditions so that a couple of years later, you'll still be able to remove the screws.Make sure that the front brake is adjusted properly after a fork overhaul.</content></section></articledata>",First name Last name,1/18/2008,suspension overhaul,"overhaul, suspension",First name Last name,1/18/2008,Published,Procedure
