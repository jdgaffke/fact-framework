        <h1> SOA Composition Service (SCS) </h1>
        <h3> What is it? </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An service for executing data operators, where operators 
                are either local (in-process) or remote (out-of-process, 
                over the network) services.</li>
            <li>Usage: 
            <ol>
                <li>A service client submits a query in XML format. 
                    The query describes the operators to invoke, and how the 
                    output of one operator feeds into the input of the next.</li>
                <li>The Composition Service executes the operators in the optimal
                    sequence, formatting the results into a XML document.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Benefits to SOA clients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides a more declarative SOA approach.</li>
            <li>Frees SOA clients from concerns of orchestrating multiple service 
                calls, stitching together results, parallelization, etc.</li>
            <li>Simplified data exchange: XML query input, XML recordset output.
                XML allows XSD-based tools.</li>
            <li>Operator metadata is self-documenting, always in sync, supports 
                searchable documentation</li>
            <li>Browser-based REPL simplifies development</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Benefits to SOA developers: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Service developers focus on implementing data operators only.
                Execution engine handles operator orchestration including 
                sequencing, parallelization, data caching, etc.</li>    
            <li>Metadata-driven access to execution engine services,
                such as automatic data caching, data security, provisioning.</li>
            <li>Handles versioning, deprecations, retirement of operators</li>
            <li>Less concern about API boundaries = faster development</li>
            <li>Execution plan tracing, statistics, resource governance.</li>
